| azure-search-openai-demo-csharp | [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo-csharp](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo-csharp) | A sample app for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation pattern running in Azure, using Azure Cognitive Search for retrieval and Azure OpenAI large language models to power ChatGPT-style and Q&A experiences. | C# | 1. **Case Scenario:** The primary use case for this project is to create ChatGPT-style and Q&A experiences over custom data using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation pattern. Specifically, it utilizes Azure Cognitive Search for data retrieval and Azure OpenAI large language models for generating responses. This setup allows users, particularly employees of a fictitious company called Contoso Electronics, to ask questions about benefits, internal policies, job descriptions, and roles. |
| AzureSpeechReactSample | [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureSpeechReactSample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureSpeechReactSample) | This sample shows how to integrate the Azure Speech service into a sample React application. This sample shows design pattern examples for authentication token exchange and management, as well as capturing audio from a microphone or file for speech-to-text conversions.| JavaScript | 1. **Case Scenario:** Use Case 1: Integrating the Azure Speech service within a React application for speech-to-text conversions, including design pattern examples for authentication token exchange and management, and capturing audio from a microphone or file. |
| azure-search-javascript-samples | [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-javascript-samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-javascript-samples) | Azure Search Javascript sample code| JavaScript | 1. **Case Scenario:** Use Case 1: This project provides sample JavaScript code for Azure AI Search, demonstrating fundamental tasks such as creating, loading, and querying a search index, as well as adding search functionality to a book catalog web app. |
| azure-search-dotnet-samples | [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples) | Azure Search .NET sample code| C# | **Use Case:** Demonstrating fundamental tasks and advanced features of Azure AI Search using .NET. This repository provides various C# sample codes, quickstarts, and tutorials to help developers create, load, query, and implement full-text and semantic search scenarios, as well as AI enrichment pipelines. It is intended for developers to learn and apply Azure AI Search functionalities in different applications, including console apps, MVC applications, and static web apps. |
| Serverless-microservices-reference-architecture | [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Serverless-microservices-reference-architecture](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Serverless-microservices-reference-architecture) | This reference architecture walks you through the decision-making process involved in designing, developing, and delivering a serverless application using a microservices architecture through hands-on instructions for configuring and deploying all of the architecture's components along the way. The goal is to provide practical hands-on experience in working with several Azure services and the technologies that effectively use them in a cohesive and unified way to build a serverless-based microservices architecture.| C# | **Use Case:** The project guides users through the decision-making process involved in designing, developing, and deploying a serverless application using a microservices architecture. It provides practical hands-on experience with several Azure services and technologies, aiming to build a cohesive and unified serverless-based microservices architecture, illustrated through the "Rideshare by Relecloud" application. |
| azd-ai-starter | [ https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azd-ai-starter]( https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azd-ai-starter) |  Creates an Azure AI Service and deploys the specified models. |  Bicep | 1. **Case Scenario:** Use Case 1: The project is intended to create an Azure AI Service and deploy specified AI models. |
